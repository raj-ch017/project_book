The vision behind this portfolio is to develop competency and learn new skills and techniques that provide a toolkit to approach problems from different directions. Projects are the best way to apply skills to a real-world scenario and expand the skillsets. This reflects my dedication to learning and gain competency in employing computational methods to tackle intricate challenges. Moreover, it showcases my pursuit of expanding my skill set, encompassing research, documentation, and code maintenance to navigate complex problem-solving scenarios effectively.
