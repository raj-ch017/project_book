This website is a platform to share my work and provide insight into my process and techniques. Each project featured here has been selected to showcase my work from scratch, ranging from 'Introduction to Python Programming' to 'Python for Research'. I aim to demonstrate the value and importance of these projects and inspire others to pursue their creative endeavours.
