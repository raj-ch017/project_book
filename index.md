The purpose of this portfolio is to enhance my skills and knowledge by developing new competencies and techniques. I believe that projects offer the best opportunity to apply these skills to real-world situations and broaden my skill set. This reflects my commitment to continuous learning and my desire to employ computational methods to solve complex challenges effectively. Additionally, my portfolio demonstrates my ability to conduct research, document my findings, and maintain code to navigate intricate problem-solving scenarios efficiently.
