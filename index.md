Hello, I am **Rajdeep Chakraborty** and this is my online portfolio.

The purpose of this book is simple: Showcasing my curiosity for learning, integrating new tools and applying them to solve real-world problems.

The vision behind this portfolio is to develop competency and learn new skills and techniques that provide a toolkit to approach problems from different dimensions. Projects are the best way to apply skills to a real-world scenario and expand the skillsets. This reflects my commitment to learning, differentiating the necessary information from noise, and quickly using this information to find solutions.

This is a lifelong pursuit - to learn and grow my understanding of the world around me. As I continue developing my career, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to solve complex and fascinating problems that expand our collective knowledge of the world. Whether through scientific research, technological innovation, or creative exploration, I am driven by the challenge of expanding the boundaries of what we know and discovering new possibilities. With each new project, I am excited to learn, grow, and contribute to the ongoing quest for knowledge and progress.
